    "What makes Data structures a diverse topic is the efficiency of different traversal/transformative/operational methods which is specific to data structures they are used for. Example, searches are the fatest with json as the index itself is the key to recognize the data set. The notebook will explore different methods applicability within the data structures and undestand its strengths or weakness. \n",
